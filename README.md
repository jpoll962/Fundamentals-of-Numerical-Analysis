# MATH4610
This repository is the course work completed and in-progress for Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics at Utah State University (USU) during the Fall Semester of 2020.

Throughout this course, I will be using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with the Windows Command Line Interface (CMD) to compile and push files.
