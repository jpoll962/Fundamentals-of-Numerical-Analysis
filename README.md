# MATH4610
This repository is the course work completed and in-progress for Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics at Utah State University (USU) during the Fall Semester of 2020.

Throughout this course, I will be using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with the Windows Command Line Interface (CMD) to compile and push files. I will
use Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code as a text editor for my code. The coding formulas, approximations, and other calculations will be written in C++. The visualizations
created for this repository will be written using Python.
