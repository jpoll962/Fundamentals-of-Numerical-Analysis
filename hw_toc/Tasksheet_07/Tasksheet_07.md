## Task 6:

Putting equations into matrices allow us to solve systems of linear equations much easier. One of the benefits is the ease of showing the system is inconstistent or consistent. In order to be consistent, the system must have at least one solution. As a result, any system that has no solution is inconsistent. One of the easiest ways to determine if a system is solveable is through Gauss-Jordan Row Reduction. This is one of the easiest routes because of the algorithmic/mindless method that leads to this determination of solveability, then the solution as well.
