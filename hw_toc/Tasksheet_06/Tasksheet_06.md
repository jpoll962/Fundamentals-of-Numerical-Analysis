According to what I found with my internet searches, root finding when there are multiple roots can be a very difficult process. This is because many of the methods do not return errors or notifications when there are two roots in a function, so you may not realize there is more than one root for a function. In addition, time/resource consumption rises with one dimensional multi-root finding because the algorithms look for one root at a time. There are two classes of one-dimensional root finding algorithms (root bracketing and root polishing). Root bracketing is good because it is guaranteed to converge, but it takes more time/resources than root polishing. Although root polishing requires less time/resources, it only converges if the initial approximation is "close enough" to a root.
