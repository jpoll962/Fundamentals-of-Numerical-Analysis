## Task 5:


## Task 6:

Both the Jacobi Method and the Gauss-Seidel Iteration Method are used for solving linear equation system Ax=b. The Jacobi Method come with two assumptions being made. Those two assumptions are: 1. the system given has a unique solution, and 2. All coefficients along the main diagonal of matrix A are nonzero. There is one main difference between the two methods. With the Jacobi Method, unknowns are updated parallel to the previous value. With the Gauss-Seidel Iteration Method, unknowns are updated differently for Lx and Ux. This allows the Gauss-Seidel Iteration Method to use the most updated value as soon as the value is known.
