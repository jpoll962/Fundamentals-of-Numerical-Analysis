The Bisection Method is when an interval is continuously cut in half to converge upon the root. If the root is inside this interval, a pro is that the root will be found. The con is that the time/resources can be a huge amount. The biggest con is if the root is not in the interval, you run into wasted resources/time. The Newton's Method uses f(x) and f'(x) to iterate through a loop until converging upon the root. Newton's Method operates upon the assumption that the root is a simple root of f(x) (con). Newton's Method is accurate and quicker than some other methods in the case of simple roots and simple f'(x) (pro). The Secant Method is much like the Newton's Method. The major difference is f'(x), in the Secant Method, is approximated rather than given directly. This is faster, but it is still data based on approximations. This can lead to inacurrate data to certain degrees.
