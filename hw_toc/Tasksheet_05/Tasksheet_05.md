The Bisection Method is when an interval is continuously cut in half to converge upon the root. The Newton's Method uses f(x) and f'(x) to iterate through a loop until converging upon the root. Newton's Method operates upon the assumption that the root is a simple root of f(x). The Secant Method is much like the Newton's Method. The major difference is f'(x), in the Secant Method, is approximated rather than given directly. (http://math.niu.edu/~dattab/MATH435.2013/ROOT_FINDING.pdf)
