## Task 6:

The condition number measures the sensitivity of the solution of a problem to perturbations in the data. The articles I read stated that the conidition number for a matrix can refer to multiple different types of numbers because it references the problem as a whole rather than only the solution. The forms they gave were: inversion, norms, and linear equations. It is used in computationally linear algebra when referring to iteration processes. The condition number value will depend on the choice of a matrix norm.
