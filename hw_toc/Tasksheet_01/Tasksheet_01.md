# Solutions for Tasksheet 1
## Task 1:
  I emailed Professor Koebbe to notify him that I will attend his Office Hours on Sept. 9th, 2020 to cover our
  required appointment.
  * Update: I met with Professor Koebbe via Zoom. (9/9/2020_13:12)

## Task 2:
  I emailed Professor Koebbe to notify him that my Github account can be found at the following link:
  [https://github.com/jpoll962](https://github.com/jpoll962)

## Task 3:
  My math4610 has been created as a private repository with Professor Koebbe as a collaborator. The repository
  has been initialized with a README.md file.
  
## Task 4:
  I emailed Professor Koebbe to notify him that I will be using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as my terminal
  throughout the class. Since it was not an option in the Tasksheet requirements, I made the Professor aware that
  I will be using Cygwin as a backup to WSL in the case that WSL does not work as needed.
  
## Task 5:
  I emailed Professor Koebbe to notify him that my Homework Table of Contents (hw_toc) can be found at the
  following link:
  [https://github.com/jpoll962/math4610/hw_toc](https://github.com/jpoll962/math4610/hw_toc)
  
## Task 6:
  I learned from searching the internet about Version Control Systems (VCS) that there are tons of options to 
  control your file system [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software). In
  addition, I learned that VCS are important to maintain different versions of the same copy to be able to
  have a backup of files when completing projects. VCS is huge for project based assignments. People can
  work on a file locally, submit it to a server, then someone else can pull that file from the server to work on
  that file on their own local computer. This streamlines team-based projects. [(Atlassin)](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
