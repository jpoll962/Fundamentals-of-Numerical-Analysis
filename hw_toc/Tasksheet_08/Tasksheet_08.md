The Hilbert Matrix is a popular Matrix throughout Mathematics. One of the articles I read cited, specifically, its use in studying digital computing during its early days. The Hilbert Matrix has a condition number that grows rapidly as the square matrix grows in number of columns/rows. Below is the growth rate for the asymptotic growth rate for the 2-norm:
