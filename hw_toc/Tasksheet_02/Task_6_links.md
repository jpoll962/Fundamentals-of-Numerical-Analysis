# Task 6 Links

I noticed the pdf didn't link the websites. Here they are:

1. [Finite Difference Methods for Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations: Steady-State and Time-Dependent Problems – Chapter 1](http://www.siam.org/books/ot98/sample/OT98Chapter1.pdf)
2. [Fundamentals of Engineering Numerical Analysis – Chapter 2, pg 14~](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Parviz_Moin/publication/245378079_Fundamentals_of_Engineering_Numerical_Analysis/links/57150bae08ae8b7c0481ac53/Fundamentals-of-Engineering-Numerical-Analysis.pdf)
3. [Numerical Differentiation: Finite Differences](http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/alcyew/handouts/numdiff.pdf)
