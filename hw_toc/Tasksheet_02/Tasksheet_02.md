# Solutions for Tasksheet 2

## Task 1:
I have chosen to use the C++ Programming Language for this class. The program I wrote for Task 1 is under the src folder in this directory.
The code is as follows:
```
//LanguageDeclaration.cpp
#include <iostream>
  
int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "I have decided to use the C++ Programming Language for this class." << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
* The code was compiled with the command: `g++ LanguageDeclaration.cpp`  
* The compilation resulted in the creation of an executable named `a.out`  
* I executed the file `a.out` with the following command: `./a.out`  
* That resulted in the printing of the following message to the screen:
```
Hello World!
I have decided to use the C++ Programming Language for this class.
```

## Task 2:
I have edited my `README.md` file to contain an introduction for the repository. In addition, there are links to my hw_toc and my software manual.

## Task 3:
I have created a hw_toc folder to hold the table of contents for the class tasksheets. In addition, I have a local version of my math4610 repository 
up and running. I have cloned it, and updated it with the `git pull` command.
